# English speaking club @ Boroda

## Overview

English Club is an open, non-commercial group. We meet different people, discuss the news and share experiences, have drinks or lunch and speak in English. Anyone can come and join the meetings. We welcome visitors from all the countries. We meet in cafes.

To be sure that you will come to the right place, follow the announcements in the group (see vk group link below).

In this club you can:
* Discuss topics that are interesting to you
* Learn something about other countries and cultures from foreigners
* Meet new friends and make good acquaintances

The discussion format is improvisational.
